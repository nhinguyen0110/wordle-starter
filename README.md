# Project 2 - *Wordle*

Submitted by: **Nhi Nguyen**

**Wordle** is an app that challenges players to guess a five-letter word within six attempts. The game provides feedback after each guess, indicating which letters are correct and in the right position (shown in green) and which letters are correct but in the wrong position (shown in yellow). The objective is to guess the target word correctly within the given number of attempts.

Time spent: **10** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] User can change the number of letters per row (the length of the goal word)
- [x] User can change the numbers of rows on the board (how many guesses allowed)
- [x] User can select a new themed set to pull the goal word from
- [x] User can select "alien wordle", causing the goal word to change after each guess

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
* Debugging Swift code, especially when dealing with asynchronous code, is challenging. Swift's strong typing can help catch some errors at compile time, but runtime errors still occur.
* Swift is a relatively new language, and it has undergone several significant updates since its introduction. Keeping up with these changes and ensuring that your code remains compatible with the latest Swift version is challenging.
